        >   HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
        >   HTML is a script created using elements
        >   Elements are HTML reserve words embedded with angle brackets
            Example: <html>...</html>
                     <head>...</head>
                     <body>...</body>

            1)  Terminator required elements
            2)  Self terminated elements
        >   Each element further contains attributes.
            Example: <h1 align='center' style='color:blue;'>We are students of HTML</h1>
        >   Elements are nested within each other in LIFO (Last In First Out) order.
